// Scroll accumulator
// ==========================================
//
// Shared rate-limited scroll accumulator used by panels that support
// scroll-to-step behaviour (exp: color fields, stepper widgets).
// (its implemented for the first place when scrolling using trackpad or holding mouse wheel,
// since that floods thousands of events that would freeze the app)
// 1. **Rate limit** : any event arriving sooner than `MIN_INTERVAL` after the
//    last *processed* event is dropped entirely, without accumulation.
//    This is nearly free (just one `Instant` comparison) and prevents every
//    raw event from triggering a full apply + rebuild + damage cycle.
//
// 2. **Step cap** : even if many fractional steps accumulated, at most
//    `MAX_STEPS_PER_CALL` whole steps are returned per call. The remainder
//    is discarded rather than carried forward to avoid a "debt" that would
//    keep firing long after the user stopped scrolling.
